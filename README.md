# MEDICAL-CT-SCANNER-SYSTEM-DESIGN
This project explores the  mechanical system design of a medical CT scanner using a structured systems engineering approach inspired  by NASAâ€™s Systems Engineering Handbook. The project encompasses the entire design process, from the  definition of stakeholder requirements to the CAD modelling and animation of the proposed solution.
