# Medical CT Scanner Mechanical System Design

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the mechanical system design of a Medical Computed Tomography (CT) scanner. It encompasses the entire design process using a structured systems engineering approach, including component selection, CAD modeling, and performance evaluation. The design aims to deliver a compact, reliable gantry for high-speed rotation and an ergonomic motorized patient table, supporting advanced X-ray tube and detector systems for high-resolution imaging.

## Key Features
- Rotating gantry structure with integrated X-ray tube and detector mounts
- Motorized patient handling table with precise positioning
- Use of industry-standard components such as Philips 800 MRC X-ray tube and NanoPanel Prism detector
- CAD modeling performed in SolidWorks, focusing on modular components and assembly
- System designed for ease of maintenance and minimal mechanical vibration
- Preliminary testing confirms compliance with safety and quality standards

## Design Methodology
- Conceptual design driven by mechanical precision and safety standards
- Detailed component selection based on imaging and mechanical performance
- CAD modeling and assembly constraints developed for spatial accuracy
- Analysis of potential challenges including thermal dissipation and alignment

## Results and Conclusion
The mechanical design successfully integrates critical components for efficient and high-quality CT imaging. Challenges such as compactness and thermal management were addressed. Further clinical validation is recommended to optimize system performance.
